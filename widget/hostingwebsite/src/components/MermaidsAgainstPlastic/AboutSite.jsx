            An estimated 11 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the ocean
            every year. Without immediate and sustained action, that amount will
            nearly triple by 2040, to 29 million metric tons per year. Thatâ€™s
            the same as dumping 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of plastic on every
            meter of coastline around the world.
